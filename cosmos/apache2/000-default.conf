	# the servername directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. this is used when creating
	# redirection urls. in the context of virtual hosts, the servername
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's host: header to
	# match this virtual host. for the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# however, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
